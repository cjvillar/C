The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.

The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.

The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.

The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
